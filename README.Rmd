This is the repo for an introduction to R using the `tidyverse` developed for [BC Stats](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/about-data-management/bc-stats).

The repo currently reflects a 1.5 day version delivered July 2018.  If you are looking for an older version, try:

* [Dec 2017: A 2.5 day version](https://github.com/cwickham/r_intro_bc_stats/tree/v1.0)

**Solutions** to "Your Turns" available at [r_intro_bc_stats_solutions](https://github.com/cwickham/r_intro_bc_stats_solutions).

## Getting these materials

To download these materials, open RStudio and on the Console run:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_course("bit.ly/rintro-bc")
```

After a pause, you'll be asked a few questions about the download process. The materials will be downloaded, unzipped and a new RStudio session will open.  

You only need to do this once.  If you close RStudio, and want to pick it up again later (i.e. on the day of the training):

* Navigate to where the folder was downloaded (if you used the default settings this should be a folder called "r_intro_bc_stats-master" on your **Desktop**)
* Double-click the file "r_intro_bc_stats.Rproj" to open up RStudio
