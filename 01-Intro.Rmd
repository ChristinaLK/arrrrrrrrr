## Running R Code

### Console

In the console in the bottom of the screen, run this command: `seq(2,31,7)`.

### Rmarkdown

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file (it has a .Rmd file extension). When you execute code within the file, the results appear beneath the code. 

#### Running Code in Rmarkdown

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button (a small green triangle) within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* on Mac). 

```{r}
#chunk tbd
```

#### Add a new code chunk

Add a new code chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd/Ctrl+Option+I*. 

Put `seq(2,31,7)`. in your new code chunk and run it.


#### Knitting RMarkdown files

We'll use RMarkdown files as notebooks as we learn because we can record text, code and output.  

RMarkdown files are also a publication format.  Try hitting the "Knit" button in the toolbar above.  R runs all the code in the document from top to bottom, it collects the output and puts the code, text and output together in an HTML document - you should see it as 01-Intro.html in the Files pane.  This document is a great way to record or share your work (you can also Knit to PDF or Word documents).

## Data Questions

Let's take a step back and think about some data. The chunks below print out some built-in R datasets: 

```{r}
starwars
```

```{r}
mpg
```

```{r}
gapminder
```

## Functions and Packages

In the section above, what kind of operations did we want to do with the data? What are some logical starting points? 

```{r}
filter(mpg, cyl == 4)
```

```{r}
heights <- pull(.data = starwars, var = height)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy), alpha = 0.2)
```
